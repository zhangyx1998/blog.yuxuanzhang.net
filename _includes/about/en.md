### About me

I am an undergraduate from Xi'an Jiao Tong University in China, majoring in Physics.

But physics is not my only interest, I am also motivated in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and many other topics.

I like the idea of sharing, and going paperless is another reason I build my own website. I will also write some blogs about the technologies used for building this website.
