From now on I am using Jekyll with GitHub Pages to build my blog site.

This blog may include my daily life, research papers and showcases of my personal projects.

The blog may use Chinese or English, depending on the need of each project.

If you happen to navigate into this site, I hope you like it.

Also, thanks a lot to [Huxpro](https://huangxuan.me) for sharing his amazingly beautiful template.
